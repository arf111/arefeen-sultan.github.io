## Personal Projects
-----------
1. **Social Distance Awareness:** Project measuring if people follow the appropriate distance between themselves in order to prevent dispersion of COVID-19 disease.
    * Bird eye view is implemented using OpenCV to precisely measure the distance between detected objects. The red lines indicate the violated distance (6 ft).
    * For detection, [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model is used (using PyTorch).
    * Github: [https://github.com/arf111/Social-Distance-Awareness.git](https://github.com/arf111/Social-Distance-Awareness.git)

2. **COVID-19 Detection from X-ray images:** Project based on detection of COVID-19 disease from X-ray images.
    * Implemented [COVID-Net [Wang et al.]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09871) from scratch using PyTorch.
    * [Focal Loss [Lin et al.]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) was implemented to handle the imbalance dataset.
    * [GradCAM [Selvaraju et al.]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) was implemented to visualize the salient regions on X-ray images for which the neural network predicted COVID-19 or not.
    * Github: [https://github.com/arf111/PyTorch_COVID-19_detection.git](https://github.com/arf111/PyTorch_COVID-19_detection.git)

## Top Undergrad Course Projects
----------------
1. **Character Recognition:** Project on recognizing characters from images using image processing and machine learning algorithms.
    * Experimented with median blur, and histogram equalization, for image pre-processing technique.
    * Achieved an accuracy of 92.2% and 59% by implementing Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor for machine learning approach.
    * Github Link: [https://github.com/arf111/Character-recognition.git](https://github.com/arf111/Character-recognition.git)
2. **SuperShop Mania:** A C# and MySQL based project on Super-Shop.
    * Transaction between customer and local store is implemented. Customers can also be approved for membership. Also they can browse product for information and reliability.
    * Warehouse has product inventory and can distribute products to local store. There is monthly, weekly and daily sales report.
    * Customer can search in different stores for product availability and can browse the top selling products of specific category.
    * Github: [https://github.com/arf111/SuperShop_Mania.git](https://github.com/arf111/SuperShop_Mania.git)
3. **Tic-Tac-Toe:** An Arduino implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game.
    * Both players can input their name at the start of the game.
    * Made the game intelligent in a sense that it can predict if the game will be draw or not before the last 2 moves in the board.
    * Github: [https://github.com/arf111/Tic-Tac-Toe.git](https://github.com/arf111/Tic-Tac-Toe.git)
4. **Journey Guider:** Web development project based on PHP and using MySQL as backend.
    * Implemented popular destinations to visit and the hotels situated on those destinations.
    * User can login and book a room on the hotel if the hotel has available room.
    * Github: [https://github.com/arf111/Journey_Guider.git](https://github.com/arf111/Journey_Guider.git)
