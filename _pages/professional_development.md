## Professional Development
-----------

### Computer Vision Nanodegree 
This Udacity Nanodegree program includes the detailed understanding and implementations on Deep Learning and Computer Vision systems.
* Worked on Facial Keypoint Detection project. This part of the nanodegree program covered detailed understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks, Maxpooling, Batch Normalization, etc.
* Worked on Image Captioning project using the combination of both CNN and RNN. This part of the nanodegree program covered in-depth understanding and implementation of object detection using YOLOv3, Attention model, and Image to Text generation.
* Implemented Landmark Detection and Robot Tracking using SLAM. This part of the nanodegree program covered topics on object motion and tracking, optical flow, robot localization, and graph SLAM.

### Deep Learning Nanodegree 
This Udacity Nanodegree program included a comprehensive understanding and implementation of Deep Learning domain.
* Worked on a project which predicts bike sharing patterns on a given day. The project covers topics on Neural Network’s foundation, mostly it’s forward propagation and backpropagation.
*  Implemented a Dog Breed Classifier which covers topics on the basic buildings of Convolutional Neural Networks, and transfer learning.
* Implemented a Fake TV script generator program. The project covered topics on text processing, RNN’s, and LSTM’s.
* Built a Face Generating Program based on Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network).The part of the nanodegree covered on the building foundation of GAN, and CycleGAN.
* Bult a sentiment analysis model, deployed the model on Amazon AWS SageMaker, and created a gateway to access it from a website. The part of this nanodegree program covered topics on Cloud Deployment.
